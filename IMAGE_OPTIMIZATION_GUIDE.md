## 📱 Testing Image Quality

After uploading and updating URLs:

1. **Desktop View**:
   - Gallery grid: Thumbnails should be crisp
   - Detail page: Full image should be high quality
   - No pixelation or blur

2. **Mobile View**:
   - Images load quickly (<2 seconds)
   - Responsive sizing works correctly
   - Touch/tap interactions smooth

3. **Network Speed**:
   - Test on slow 3G connection
   - Images should progressively load
   - Consider adding loading skeletons

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Filename Best Practices:
✅ Good: `king-menes.jpg`, `king-menes-thumb.jpg`
❌ Bad: `King Menes (1).JPG`, `IMG_1234.jpg`

### Aspect Ratio Consistency:
- All images should be 3:4 ratio (portrait)
- This ensures uniform grid layout
- No awkward stretching or cropping

### Color Space:
- Use sRGB color space for web
- Not Adobe RGB or CMYK
- Ensures consistent colors across devices

### Metadata:
- Remove EXIF data for privacy
- TinyPNG does this automatically
- Reduces file size slightly
