## 🆘 Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to resize images?**
A: Not mandatory! Your original product images will work. Compression is more important.

**Q: Which hosting is best?**
A: **ImgBB** for speed. **IPFS/Pinata** for blockchain authenticity. Your choice!

**Q: What if images don't load?**
A: Check the URL format. ImgBB direct links should end in `.jpg` or `.png`

**Q: Can I test with just one image first?**
A: Yes! Update just `nft-001` (King Menes) first, test it, then do the rest.

**Q: How long does this take?**
