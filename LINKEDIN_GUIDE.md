```
Just finished building Moonlight Clothing - a full-stack e-commerce platform for African-inspired fashion.

What it does:
- 95 products with filtering and search
- Shopping cart and checkout with Paystack payment integration
- User accounts and order tracking
- WhatsApp integration for customer messages
- Fully responsive on mobile

Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The trickiest part was getting the Paystack payment flow working correctly and managing state across the whole app using Context API.

Learned a ton about API integration, database design, and building something that actually works end-to-end.

Code is on GitHub: https://github.com/Trustthefineboy/moonlight-clothing-site

Open to full-stack developer roles if anyone's hiring.
